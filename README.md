## Full Stack Developer | Passionate Coder | Seeking Software Engineering Opportunities

Hi there! I'm a final year CSE student who's passionate about coding with a love for learning and reading. Ever since childhood, programming has fascinated me, and I am constantly honing my skills to build innovative solutions. Currently, I’m focusing on becoming a full stack developer, diving deep into both front-end and back-end technologies, with a primary focus on Python.

## 📚 What I'm Learning:

Python: Exploring various concepts from basics to advanced, while working on real-world projects.
Full Stack Development: Building expertise in both front-end (HTML, CSS) and back-end (Python, Java) technologies.
APIs & Data Structures: Sharpening my skills with coding challenges, APIs, and algorithms.

## 🚀 Always Evolving

I’m always exploring new technologies, frameworks, and tools to improve my coding skills and become a better developer. Feel free to explore my repositories and let’s connect if you're interested in collaborating on exciting projects!
